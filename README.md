# Introduction to Dataset

FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, oversees the federal response to disasters and emergencies in the United States.  FEMA allocates federal resources to municipalities, businesses, and individuals facing disasters and disaster recovery efforts.  Although much of FEMA’s effort is focused on large disaster recovery efforts, it also provides aid directly to households affected by disasters through its Individuals and Households Program (IHP).  The IHP, according to FEMA documentation, “provides financial and direct services to eligible individuals and households affected by a disaster who have uninsured or underinsured necessary expenses and serious needs” (FEMA, 2019).

This data warehouse seeks to provide meaningful insight into the data collected from households participating in the IHP program, so FEMA (or another third party) can ascertain which areas have been hit hardest, which disasters had the biggest impact, if demographic factors play a role in aid, along with other geographic and demographic insights.


# Key Business Questions
1.	In the last [time span], what [geographic area] has been awarded the most IHP relief dollars?
2.	How many disasters were declared in [geographic area] during [timeframe]?
3.	In which [time span] does FEMA award the most IHP relief dollars?
4.	What percentage of individuals requesting aid are granted it, and how does that compare with the volume of requests?
5.	What proportion of dollars awarded were allocated for Other Needs as compared to Housing Assistance in the last [time span]?
6.	What are the most awarded disaster types? Is time of year a factor?
7.	What proportion of dollars awarded were allocated for Other Needs as compared to Housing Assistance in the last [time span]?
8.	Is more aid awarded to Other Needs, or Housing Assistance and has it changed over time?
